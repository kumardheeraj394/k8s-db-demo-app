## 1. Basics & Core Concepts

### What is Kubernetes?  
An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Why use Kubernetes?  
Benefits include scalability, self-healing, automated rollouts, and easy management of containerized applications.

### Kubernetes Architecture

**Master Components:**  
- **API Server:** Frontend for the Kubernetes control plane; validates and configures API objects.  
- **Controller Manager:** Runs controllers to ensure the desired state matches actual state.  
- **Scheduler:** Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and policies.  
- **etcd:** Distributed key-value store for cluster data persistence.

**Node Components:**  
- **Kubelet:** Agent on each node managing pod lifecycle.  
- **Kube-proxy:** Network proxy/load balancer on each node.  
- **Container Runtime:** Runs containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

```
+-------------------+             +--------------------+
|      Master       |             |       Node         |
| +---------------+ |             | +----------------+ |
| | API Server    |<------------->|  Kubelet       | |
| +---------------+ |             | +----------------+ |
| | Controller    | |             | | Kube-proxy     | |
| | Manager       | |             | +----------------+ |
| | Scheduler     | |             | | Container      | |
| +---------------+ |             | | Runtime        | |
| | etcd          | |             | +----------------+ |
+-------------------+             +--------------------+
```

## 2. Kubernetes Installation & Setup

- Minikube (local single-node cluster)  
- kubeadm (manual multi-node cluster setup)  
- Managed Kubernetes (AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS)  
- kubectl CLI tool  
- Kubernetes Dashboard UI  

---

## 3. Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments

- **Pods:** Smallest deployable unit; can contain multiple containers.  
- **Pod Lifecycle:** Pending â†’ Running â†’ Succeeded / Failed â†’ Unknown  

Example commands:  
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide  
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>  
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

- **ReplicaSet & Self-healing:** Ensures desired number of pod replicas are running, replaces failed pods automatically.  
- **Deployment Object:** Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates, supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

---

## 4. Services & Networking

- **What is a Kubernetes Service?**  
  Provides stable network endpoints to access Pods, which have dynamic IPs.

| Type         | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ClusterIP    | Internal IP accessible only within cluster (default). |
| NodePort     | Exposes service on a static port on each Node.      |
| LoadBalancer | Creates external load balancer in supported clouds. |
| ExternalName | Maps service to external DNS name.                   |

- **DNS & CoreDNS:** Provides service discovery inside the cluster.  
- **Headless Service:** No cluster IP, used for direct pod access (e.g., StatefulSets).  
- **Ingress & Network Policies:** Manage external access and network traffic rules.

---

## 5. Config & Secrets Management

- **ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive config data as key-value pairs.  
- **Secrets:** Store sensitive info securely (passwords, tokens).  
- Inject as environment variables or mounted files.  
- Volume mounting for configuration files inside containers.

---

## 6. Volumes & Storage

- **EmptyDir:** Temporary pod-local storage.  
- **HostPath:** Mount node filesystem into pod (use carefully).  
- **Persistent Volumes (PV):** Cluster-wide storage resources.  
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):** User requests for storage.  
- **StorageClasses:** Define different storage types and provisioners.  
- **Dynamic Provisioning:** Auto-creates PVs when PVCs are made.

---

## 7. Stateful Applications

- **StatefulSets:** Manage stateful applications with stable network IDs and persistent storage.  
- Use with PVCs and Headless Services for stable identity and storage.  
- Common for databases like MongoDB, MySQL clusters.
